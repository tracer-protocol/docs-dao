# Treasury Management

The Treasury Management Fund is a 3/5 multisig held by the Treasury Management Team and two independent third-party signatories. Established on February 8, 2022 via [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xec0350ef1040fd328b78fb8dfbda879ed00f1795e78a01089401539f5f77f352), the Treasury Management Fund aims to:&#x20;

1. maintain a strong fiscal position for Tracer DAO operations;
2. and, subject to that, to support the growth of Tracer DAO by maximising _risk-adjusted_ returns and optimising capital efficiency.

## Wallet Management&#x20;

The Treasury Management Fund is managed by the **Treasury Management Team** subject to the oversight of the **Treasury** **Management Council**. Because Tracer is a community-led DAO, the Treasury Management Fund (and related bodies) operate in accordance with the Treasury Management Fund Remit (**TMF Remit**), as confirmed and amended, from time to time, by community vote.&#x20;

The **Treasury Management Team** are serving a twelve month term from February 8, 2022, subject to renewal by the community. Each member holds a key to the Treasury Management Fund multisig.

## Policy Management <a href="#treasury-management-council-4" id="treasury-management-council-4"></a>

### Treasury Management Council <a href="#treasury-management-council-4" id="treasury-management-council-4"></a>

A **Treasury Management Council** (TMC) is composed of the **Treasury Management Team** and two **Independent Council Members**. The Treasury Management Council has the authority to decide on certain Treasury Management Fund policies and matters that require a heightened level of scrutiny but fall short of requiring a full community vote. The members are serving a twelve month term (from February 8, 2022), subject to renewal by the community. Decisions will be made by a simple majority.

The Treasury Management Council are responsible for:

1. reviewing and monitoring Treasury Management Fund performance;
2. setting policies to mitigate risk (including, but not limited to strategy risk, market risk, smart contract risk, counterparty risk, legal risk, and token exposure risk);
3. set and monitor risk limits and concentration limits; and
4. whitelisting protocols and strategies available to the Treasury Management Fund, subject in each case to its community-proscribed remit (**TMF Remit**).

The Treasury Management Council deliver a quarterly report, uploaded via Discourse, reporting on:

1. the overall performance of the Treasury Management Fund;
2. portfolio composition and risk assessment; and
3. material changes to Treasury Management Fund policies.

### Independent Council Members

**Independent Council Members** are available to meet and discuss policies as needed, attend Treasury Management Council quarterly review meetings, and approve the TMC quarterly report to the community. The members are serving a twelve month term (from February 8, 2022), subject to renewal by the community.&#x20;

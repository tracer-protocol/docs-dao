# Growth Fund

Expedited and coordinated decision making is required for DAOs to remain efficient, responsive, and competitive within the market. However, a formal decentralised governance process take days to undergo proposal, voting and execution. It takes 4-9 days for Tracer DAO governance proposals to pass. The Tracer Growth Fund was established on September 2, 2021 via [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmNYJ8HC13Pf2kug72qKFfpHfK6EV8k7u6qh6iYawT4ng7) to solve this issue, and allow Tracer DAO to efficiently allocate tokens to growth opportunities and operational expenditure.&#x20;
